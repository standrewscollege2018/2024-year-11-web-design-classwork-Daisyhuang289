                <p class = "blue">DDoS attacks are carried out with networks of Internet-connected machines.</p>
                <p class = "green">These networks consist of computers and other devices (such as IoT devices)which have been infected with malware, allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker. These individual devices are referred to as bots (or zombies), and a group of bots is called a botnet.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Once a botnet has been established, the attacker is able to direct an attack by sending remote instructions to each bot.</p>
                <p class = "green">When a victim’s server or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot sends requests to the target’s IP address, potentially causing the server or network to become overwhelmed, resulting in a denial-of-service to normal traffic.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Because each bot is a legitimate Internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.</p>
                <p class = "green">A DDoS attack is essentially the legitimate use of an online service taken too far. For example, a website may be capable of handling a certain number of requests per minute. If that number is exceeded, then the website’s performance is degraded, or it may be rendered completely inaccessible. This overload may be caused by an attack or even legitimate use, such as an e-commerce site being overwhelmed on Black Friday or a ticket sales platform going down when sales for a popular event are opened.</p>
                <p class = "blue">DDoS attacks are capable of overwhelming a target at various levels. For example, a web application may have a maximum number of requests that it can handle. Alternatively, the server that it is running on may have a limit on the amount of simultaneous connections that it can manage. A corporate network likely has bandwidth restrictions that could be overwhelmed by an attacker. Exceeding any of these thresholds will result in a DoS attack — or a DDoS attack if the attack uses multiple IP addresses — against the system.</p>
                <p class = "green">Most DDoS attacks are done with botnets – groups of computers all acting together. These computers will all attempt to access a website simultaneously, overwhelming the server and bringing it down.
                </p>
                <p class = "blue">How do they get these botnets? By hijacking other machines. Often, a hacker will use malware or take advantage of an unpatched vulnerability on someone else’s server to gain access to it via Command and Control (C2) software. By leveraging these exploits, hackers are able to amass large numbers of computers in a relatively cheap and easy way, which they can then deploy for their own nefarious purposes.
                </p>
                <p class = "green">Once they have control over enough machines, the hackers can then issue a command to the entire botnet, which then attempts to access the target server. When too many computers are trying to access a server all at once, service outages are common. The end result is an interruption in service and lost productivity.
                </p>
                <p class = "blue">This can be anything from a childish prank to revenge against a business. And while it sounds harmless at first, it’s important to know that the average cost of a DDoS attack to even small business operations can be as much as $120,000 – enough to bring many small businesses to their knees. Large corporations can lose millions.
