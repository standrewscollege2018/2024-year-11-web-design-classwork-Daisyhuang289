           China was ruled by various dynasties for much of its history. The first dynasty is believed to be the Xia dynasty which formed somewhere around 2250 BC. The Shang and Yin dynasty gained power around the 14th century BC. The Han dynasty, which lasted over 400 years from 206 BC to 220 AD, was one of the most influential in China's history. Much of the culture today was created during the Han dynasty. Later famous dynasties, like the Song and the Tang, continued to refine the culture and bring new innovations to the world including printed money, a permanent navy, and a complex government that ruled over 100 million people.

           The last of the grat dynasties, the Qing dynasty, began in 1644. The Ming dynasty was in power, but was overthrown by the Manchus who put the Qing dynasty into power. During the Qing dynasty, western influences, European trade, and a number of wars all served to weaken China, Gret Britain gained control of Hong Kong after the Opium Wars.

           In the early 1900s the people of China began to want reform. Revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen created the Chinese Nationalist Peoples Party, also called the KMT or Kuomintang. After Sun Yat-sen died, Chiang Kai-shek became the leader of the party. However, Chiang turned on the leaders of the CCP, the communist party, and had many of them killed. The Chinese Civil War broke out between the KMT and the communists. A new leader, Mao Zedong took over the communists and led the CCP on a famous "Long March" to a distant are of China. There they regrouped and eventually gained strength to force Chiang Kai-shek out of China and to the island of Taiwan.

           Mao Zedong established the Peoples Republic of China on October 1, 1949. This new government was strongly allied with the Soviet Union and modeled its government after Soviet communism.

           In 1985, Mao Zedong embarked on a new plan called the Great Leap Foward. Unfortunately, this plan backfired and China experiences a terrible famine including much starvation and death. Over the next several decades China would struggle with political reform and economic policy. Today, China is a major world power and the second largest economy in the world.
