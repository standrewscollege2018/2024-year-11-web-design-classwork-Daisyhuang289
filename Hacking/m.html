                <h3 class = "other">Types of malware</h3>
                <p class = "blue">Different types of malware have the following unique traits and characteristics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virus. A virus is the most common type of malware that can execute itself and spread by infecting other programs 
                    or files.
                     </li>
                     <li>Worm. A worm can self-replicate without a host program and typically spreads without any interaction from the 
                    malware authors.</li>
                    <li>Trojan horse. A Trojan horse is designed to appear as a legitimate software program to gain access to a system. 
                    Once activated following installation, Trojans can execute their malicious functions.</li>
                    <li>Spyware. Spyware collects information and data on the device and user, as well as observes the user's activity 
                    without their knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Ransomware. Ransomware infects a user's system and encrypts its data. Cybercriminals then demand a ransom 
                    payment from the victim in exchange for decrypting the system's data.</li>
                    <li>Rootkit. A rootkit obtains administrator-level access to the victim's system. Once installed, the program gives threat 
                    actors root or privileged access to the system.</li>
                    <li>Backdoor virus. A backdoor virus or remote access Trojan (RAT) secretly creates a backdoor into an infected 
                    computer system that lets threat actors remotely access it without alerting the user or the system's security 
                    programs.</li>
                    <li>Adware. Adware tracks a user's browser and download history with the intent to display pop-up or banner 
                    advertisements that lure the user into making a purchase. For example, an advertiser might use cookies to track 
                    the webpages a user visits to better target advertising.</li>
                    <li>Keyloggers. Keyloggers, also called system monitors, track nearly everything a user does on their computer. This 
                    includes writing emails, opening webpages, accessing computer programs and typing keystrokes.
                     </li>
                     <li>Logic bombs. This type of malicious malware is designed to cause harm and typically gets inserted into a system 
                    once specific conditions are met. Logic bombs stay dormant and are triggered when a certain event or condition is 
                    met, such as when a user takes a specific action on a certain date or time.
                     </li>
                     <li>Exploits. Computer exploits take advantage of existing vulnerabilities, flaws or weaknesses in a system's hardware 
                    or software. Instead of depending on social engineering tactics to execute, they exploit technical vulnerabilities to 
                    gain unauthorized access and perform other malicious activities such as executing arbitrary code inside a system.</li>
                    <li>Adware — commonly called “spam” — is unwanted or malicious advertising installed on an endpoint. While relatively harmless, it can be irritating, as adware can hamper your computer’s performance. In addition, these ads may lead users to download more harmful types of malware inadvertently through clicking on links in the malicious ads. To defend against adware, make sure you keep your operating system, web browser, and email client updated so they can block known adware attacks before they are able to download and install.</li>
