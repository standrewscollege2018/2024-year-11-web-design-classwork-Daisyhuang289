                <p class = "green">Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that's intentionally harmful to a computer, network or server.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Types of malware include computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware and spyware. These malicious programs steal, encrypt and delete sensitive data; alter or hijack core computing functions; and monitor end users' computer activity.</p>
                <p class = "green">Malware is software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called hackers) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware.</p>
                <p class = "green">Malware is a catch-all term for any type of malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device, service or network. Cybercriminals typically use it to extract data that they can leverage over victims for financial gain. That data can range from financial data, to healthcare records, to personal emails and passwordsâ€”the possibilities of what sort of information can be compromised have become endless.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called hackers) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Recent malware attacks have exfiltrated data in mass amounts.</p>
                <p class = "green">Malicious software, or malware, is any software code or computer program, including ransomware, Trojan horses and spyware, intentionally written to harm computer systems or their users.
                </p>
                <p class = "green">Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware. These malicious programs can take many forms, ranging from highly damaging and costly ransomware to merely annoying adware, depending on what cybercriminals aim to do.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Cybercriminals develop and use malware to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold devices, data or entire enterprise networks hostage for large sums of money.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or digital assets.
                    </li>
                    <li>Steal login credentials, credit card numbers, intellectual property or other valuable information.
                    </li>
                    <li>Disrupt critical systems that businesses and government agencies rely on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class = "green">There are billions of malware attacks every year ( link resides outside ibm.com), and malware infections can happen on any device or operating system. Windows, Mac, iOS and Android systems can all fall victim.</p>
                <p class = "green">Increasingly, malware attacks target businesses rather than individual users as hackers have learned that it's more lucrative to go after organizations. Companies often hold significant amounts of personal data, and the hackers exploit this fact to extort large sums of money from them. The hackers can use this personal data for identity theft or sell it on the dark web.
