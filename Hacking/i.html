                <p class = "green">Social engineering attacks take advantage of this vulnerability by conning unsuspecting people into compromising security and giving out sensitive information. Social engineers use various psychological hacks to trick you into trusting them or create a false sense of urgency and anxiety to lower your natural defenses.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Social engineering is a crime, so malicious threats do not consider ethics when targeting individuals and corporations. Everyone is a target for an attacker, so both individuals and employees should be aware of how social engineering is carried out.</p>
                <p class = "green">This manipulative technique exploits human vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information, systems, or resources. While technical defenses are crucial, the human element remains a critical weak point.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Because users are the main target in social engineering attacks, organizations need to work to turn their employees into a major line of defense.</p>
                <p class = "green">Overall, it is believed that SE attack is usually a targeted attack, and people who score high in agreeableness and extroversion are likely to fall victims more than other personality traits.</p>
                <p class = "blue">The more access someone has to what criminals want, the more attractive that target becomes. Victims of social engineering attacks are most often: High-worth individuals, high-profile employees, and high-level leaders.</p>
                <p class = "green">This is a more targeted version of the phishing scam whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or enterprises. They then tailor their messages based on characteristics, job positions, and contacts belonging to their victims to make their attack less conspicuous.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Most social engineering attacks rely on a sense of urgency to make victims act quickly without noticing suspicious signs. Messages prompt targets to pay an invoice or reset their password within 24 hours, for example.</p>
                <p class = "green">Most social engineering attacks rely on actual communication between attackers and victims. The attacker tends to motivate the user into compromising themselves, rather than using brute force methods to breach your data.</p>
