                <h3 class = "other">How doe malware infections happen?</h3>
                <p class = "blue">Malware authors use a variety of physical and virtual means to spread malware that infects devices and networks, including the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Removable drives. Malicious programs can be delivered to a system with a USB drive or external hard drive. For 
                    example, malware can be automatically installed when an infected removable drive connects to a PC.</li>
                    <li>Infected websites. Malware can find its way into a device through popular collaboration tools and drive-by 
                    downloads, which automatically download programs from malicious websites to systems without the user's 
                    approval or knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Phishing attacks. Phishing attacks use phishing emails disguised as legitimate messages containing malicious 
                    links or attachments to deliver the malware executable file to unsuspecting users. Sophisticated malware attacks 
                    often use a command-and-control server that lets threat actors communicate with the infected systems, exfiltrate 
                    sensitive data and even remotely control the compromised device or server.</li>
                    <li>Obfuscation techniques. Emerging strains of malware include new evasion and obfuscation techniques designed to 
                    fool users, security administrators and antimalware products. Some of these evasion techniques rely on simple 
                    tactics, such as using web proxies to hide malicious traffic or source Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. More 
                    sophisticated cyberthreats include polymorphic malware that can repeatedly change its underlying code to avoid 
                    detection from signature-based detection tools; anti-sandbox techniques that enable malware to detect when it's 
                    being analyzed and to delay execution until after it leaves the sandbox; and fileless malware that resides only in 
                    the system's RAM to avoid being discovered.</li>
                    <li>Software from third-party websites. There are instances where malware can be downloaded and installed on a 
                    system concurrently with other programs or apps. Typically, software from third-party websites or files shared over 
                    peer-to-peer networks falls under this category. For example, a computer running a Microsoft operating system 
                    (OS) might end up unknowingly installing software that Microsoft would deem as a potentially unwanted program 
                    (PUP). However, by checking a box during the installation, users can avoid installing unwanted software.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class = "green">Malware can use known software vulnerabilities to infect your PC. A vulnerability is like a hole in your software that can give malware access to your PC.
                </p>
                <p class = "green">When you go to a website, it can try to use vulnerabilities in your web browser to infect your PC with malware. The website might be malicious or it could be a legitimate website that has been compromised or hacked.
                </p>
                <p class = "green">This is why it's extremely important to keep all your software, and especially your web browser, up to date and remove software you don't use. That includes unused browser extensions.
                </p>
                <p class = "green">You can reduce your chances of getting malware in this way by using a modern browser, like Microsoft Edge, and keeping it updated.
