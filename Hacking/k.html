                <h3 class = "other">What does malware do?</h3>
                <p class = "green">Malware can infect networks and devices and is designed to harm those devices, networks and their users in some way. Depending on the type of malware and its goal, this harm might present itself differently to the user or endpoint. In some cases, the effect of malware is relatively mild and benign, and in others, it can be disastrous.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Malware can typically perform the following harmful actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is a common objective of malware. During data exfiltration, once a system is infected with malware, threat actors can steal sensitive information stored on the system, such as emails, passwords, intellectual property, financial information and login credentials. Data exfiltration can result in monetary or reputational damage to individuals and organizations</li>
                    <li>Service disruption. Malware can disrupt services in several ways. For example, it can lock up computers and make them unusable or hold them hostage for financial gain by performing a ransomware attack. Malware can also target critical infrastructure, such as power grids, healthcare facilities or transportation systems to cause service disruptions.</li>
                    <li>Data espionage. A type of malware known as spyware performs data espionage by spying on users. Typically, hackers use keyloggers to record keystrokes, access web cameras and microphones and capture screenshots.</li>
                    <li>Identity theft. Malware can be used to steal personal data which can be used to impersonate victims, commit fraud or gain access to additional resources. According to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024, there was a 71% rise in cyberattacks using stolen identities in 2023 compared to the previous year.</li>
                    <li>Stealing resources. Malware can use stolen system resources to send spam emails, operate botnets and run cryptomining software, also known as cryptojacking.</li>
                    <li>System damage. Certain types of malware, such as computer worms, can damage devices by corrupting the system files, deleting data or changing system settings. This damage can lead to an unstable or unusable system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class = "green">No matter the method, all types of malware are designed to exploit devices at the user's expense and to benefit the hacker -- the person who has designed or deployed the malware.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Malware (short for “malicious software”) is a file or code, typically delivered over a network, that infects, explores, steals or conducts virtually any behavior an attacker wants. And because malware comes in so many variants, there are numerous methods to infect computer systems.</p>
