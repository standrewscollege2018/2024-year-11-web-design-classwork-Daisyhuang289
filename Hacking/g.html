                <p class = "green">Social engineering refers to all techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Social engineering is the tactic of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving a victim in order to gain control over a computer system, or to steal personal and financial information.</p>
                <p class = "green">The number one type of social engineering attack is phishing. IC3 reports that socially engineered business email compromise is the costliest cybercrime. Socially engineered cyberattacks are just under 80% effective. An estimated 70 â€“ 90 % of breaches are caused by social engineering.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Social Engineering relies heavily on the six Principles of Influence established by Robert Cialdini, a behavioral psychologist, and author of Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. Those six key Principles are: Reciprocity, Commitment and Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, and Scarcity.</p>
                <p class = "green">What makes social engineering especially dangerous is that it relies on human error, rather than vulnerabilities in software and operating systems.</p>
                <p class = "blue">A social engineering attacker fabricates a pretext that is familiar to targets, and then preys on their cognitive biases to lull them into a false sense of security and trust. In short, the attacker assumes an alter ego that targets are expected to trust inherently.</p>
                <p class = "green">Agreeable people tend to be more willing to share information. Meanwhile, extroverts tend to be more transparent when they start talking. They are very open about what they do and who they are, thus making them more susceptible to social engineering.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Hackers leverage social engineering in as much as 90% of all cyberattacks. Social engineering is effective because it relies on the human tendency to trust, fear, or oblige to orders.</p>
                <p class = "green">A social engineer will manipulate their target using email, phone, or in-person tactics to acquire confidential information. Through observing personal mentalities, reoccurring routines, and relationships, the social engineer can develop the appearance of an individual you might naturally trust.</p>
                <p class = "blue">Cybercriminals rarely choose their victims at random. The first stage of the cyber kill chain is reconnaissance, where an attacker narrows down a list of targets based on organization profile, security posture, and vulnerable individuals.</p>
